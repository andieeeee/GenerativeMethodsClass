This page showcases a thought experiment on chasing money or community as long-term sustainable strategies. The intention was to argue that chasing community is a better long-term strategy than chasing money. Overall, I liked the results of the simulations as there was interesting emergent behavior to watch.

## Simulation 1 - Chasing money
### Characters
1. Money Objects - ðŸ’°
2. Empty Squares - â–¡
3. Ambitious Person - ðŸ•´
4. Ecstatic Person - ðŸ•º

### Rules
1. If you are an ambitious person ðŸ•´
  1. If you are next to a money object ðŸ’°, 25% become ecstatic people ðŸ•º, 30% become empty squares â–¡
  2. Otherwise, 30% become empty squares â–¡
2. If you are an empty square â–¡:
  1. If you are next to an ecstatic person, 50% chance of becoming an ecstatic person
  2. If you are next to an ambitious person, 25% chance of becoming an ambitious person
  3. Otherwise, 15% chance of becoming an ambitious person ðŸ•´, 5% chance of becoming an ecstatic person ðŸ•º
3. If you are an ecstatic person ðŸ•º, 10% become ambitious people ðŸ•´, 55% become empty squares â–¡
4. If you are a money object ðŸ’°, do nothing.

## Simulation 2 - Chasing community
### Characters
1. Empty Squares - â–¡
2. Ambitious Person - ðŸ•´
3. Ecstatic Person - ðŸ•º

### Rules
1. If you are an ambitious person ðŸ•´:
  1. If you are next to an ambitious person ðŸ•´, 15% become empty squares â–¡, 25% become ecstatic people ðŸ•º
  2. Otherwise, 30% become empty squares â–¡
2. If you are an empty square â–¡:
  1. If you are next to an ecstatic person, 50% chance of becoming an ecstatic person
  2. If you are next to an ambitious person, 25% chance of becoming an ambitious person
  3. Otherwise, 15% chance of becoming an ambitious person ðŸ•´, 5% chance of becoming an ecstatic person ðŸ•º
3. If you are an ecstatic person ðŸ•º:
  1. If next to an ecstatic person ðŸ•º, 15% become empty squares â–¡, 5% become ambitious people ðŸ•´
  2. Otherwise, 10% become ambitious people ðŸ•´, 55% become empty squares â–¡

3. If you are an ecstatic person ðŸ•º:
  1. If next to an ecstatic person ðŸ•º, 15% become empty squares â–¡, 5% become ambitious people ðŸ•´
  2. Otherwise, 10% become ambitious people ðŸ•´, 55% become empty squares â–¡
4. If you are a money object ðŸ’°, do nothing.

## Thank You's
I appreciated Kevin Simler's approach of building an argument using interactive simulations by slowly adding more complexity and abstraction at each step.
