This page showcases different particles and swarm behavior with debug information.

Particles:
üå† - Shooting Stars - Constant velocity shooting stars. Particles draw to lightmap.

üçñ - Meat - Flow field driven meat. Particles draw to lightmap.

üèÉ - Runner - A Braitenberg Vehicle that loves meat and is curious about shooting stars. Reads from the lightmap.

Controls:
- Pause button and spacebar pause the simulation.
- Deploy buttons for each particle are used by clicking on the canvas.
- Debug toggle buttons for each particle enable visual aids on the canvas.
- Parameter sliders allow for tuning of the simulation.

## Instructions
Use the buttons and sliders to play with the simulation.

## Thank You's
