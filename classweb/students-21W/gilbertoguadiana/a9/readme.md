# Gilberto Guadiana
The concept for this mask is inspired by Blue Demon's mask, a Mexican wrestler, as well as Rorschach's mask from Watchmen.

## Sliders
1. noise - adjusts the Perlin noise value used for creating the geometry on the mask
2. connections - adjusts the number of connections for the geometry on the mask
3. lightness - adjusts the maximum lightness used in the color of the fill for the geometry on the mask
