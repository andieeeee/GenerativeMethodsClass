This page showcases different drawing tools.

Tools:
The bomb button is used to clear the canvas to a white background.

The rainbow button is used to clear the canvas to a randomly colored background.

The mandala tool is used to reflect strokes pseudo-symmetrically over the origin a given number of times. Every time you release your mouse, the number of reflections changes for the tool.

The spray tool is used to blend pixels in the pixel buffer in a rectangular region near where the mouse is clicked and dragged.

The anchor tool is used to draw fish hook looking objects on screen.
