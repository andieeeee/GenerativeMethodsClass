## Instructions
Bot Responses:
1. Recommends a blockchain to invest in after you write "invest" in your text.
2. Shares a vision of the future of blockchain after you write "future"
3. Evaluates your blockchain negatively and compares to another blockchain after you write "I like blockchain" and tell it your favorite blockchain.
