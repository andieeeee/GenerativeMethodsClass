This project is trying to describe a simplified framework of how our shopping decisions are influenced by people around us (before the Internet era?), based on my naive understanding of marketing.

The layout and the code are adapted from Prof. Kate Compton's example code. The mechanisms of the "random", "forward by one step", and "play" buttons and the mouse selects/clicks are the same. Here, an emoji in a box means "the person purchased the item". The darkness and the hue of the boxes reflect the following three conditions/factors presumably influencing our shopping decisions:

1. the tendency of being influenced by people around us (the darkenss)
2. our budget compared to the price, i.e. whether we can afford it (the blue/red hue)
3. how much our friends advocate/criticize the item (adds to/subtracts from the darkness)

These three factors are added to the simulations one at a time. The specific implementation is described on the webpage. We can at least see how fashion spreads among groups of people that are more easily influenced by their friends. Lower price can lower the barrier. Higher quality can potentially motivate people to advocate for the product and expand the market share. 

Many assumptions are made, including the distribution of the three factors among people, the distribution of spontaneous purchases, the threshold above which a person would purchase an item, etc. Many more factors, which interconnect with each other, can contribute to such a complex behavior. Furthermore, in this era of Internet, our shopping decisions are not only influenced by people around us, but also by people from all over the world on the Internet. This framework is far from representing the truth, but can be a starting point.
