Welcome to my webpage!

You can click the button "Show All" to display the links to the assignments. The button will change to "Hide All" and you can click it again to hide the assignments. These events will also print "Assignments are shown/hidden!", respectively, to the console.

The picture was taken by myself.

The fonts are Yusei Magic and Lato from Google Fonts. The color palette is called Eggshell from coolors.co.
