**Inspiration**
Upon seeing this application, my immediate thought was to draw masks for traditional Chinese opera characters. I don't know much about the history of Chinese opera, but its wide variety of costumes and makeups has always been fascinating to me.

In this project, I made a simplified mask that's typical for female warrior characters "Dao Ma Dan". They always look beautiful to me.

**Drawing**
Most of my efforts were on the head decorations. The actual head decorations for "Dao Ma Dan" in Chinese opera are much much more sophisticated and beautiful, but I hope to capture the essence of it. 

The eyelines and eye shadows are harder to draw than they appear to be, because the shapes of eyelines and eye shadows in Chinese opera are very different from the set of points for eye rings. Therefore, the outlines actually crossed multiple eye rings.

I intended to include some tassels on the sides of the head, using the spring system and bezier curves. They worked, but didn't turn out as appealing as I wanted. Due to the time limitation, I left them out for now.

**Sliders**
In contrast to the "Array of Floats" project, not many slider variations are allowed in this work, because I hope to preserve the art style. 
1. SpheresAngle: Changes the tilt angles of the red pom-poms on the hat.
2. PerlsLength: Changes the length of the perl clips on the head.
3. CircleSize: Changes the size of the round hair decorations on the forehead.
