This is a chatbot that pitches ideas about new characters to you. I am a fan of League of Legends, so the style of the characters is like those in the LoL universe.

The character has a few attributes: class, name, title, birthplace, what they do/like/hate.
* class ‚Äì fighter or mage;
* name ‚Äì from a Unisex name generator: https://www.random-name-generators.com/g/unisex;
* **title, birthplace, and what they do ‚Äì generated using Tracery.**

You get to pick if you want a fighter or a mage, and you can like or dislike an idea by clicking the üòç or ü§® button. **An input message will also be generated using Tracery upon clicking the button.** 

Once you dislike an attribute, the bot will keep proposing another idea on that attribute until you approve. It will then move to the next attribute. Once all the attributes are approved, we finish building this character and will start over.

The framework of the chatbot is based on Prof. Kate Compton's example code. I switched the sides of the player and the bot (player on the right and bot on the left), which is more natural to me personally.
