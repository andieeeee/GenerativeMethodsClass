Assignment 4: Particles & Swarms

You are now under the force!

"The Flamethrower": You can click on the ðŸ”¥ symbol to play with fire. Be careful! 
In case you wanna know where the fire's coming from and headed, well you guessed it, "it's a fiery life!" (Seriously tho, click on that button. You might thank me later)

"The Rise of the ...." I'm sorry I can't tell you more about it. You'll have to see for yourself. But remember this, it was inevitable.

"Entangled": Well, it's your basic love story. Particles can't get enough of each other and keep flocking. I can't say whether it's true love or not. After all, they say keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
(You may use the boid/spot debug to decide for yourself)

"Wind, Oh Wind": The wind had to ruin everything. All my sparkly shiny marbles are now floating haphazardly. Please help me retrieve them and find out where the wind is coming from?
