Distracted? Find it hard to focus? Do you find yourself taking study breaks too frequently? Do you fantasize about food sometimes while studying Math?

Well here we go! Presenting to you: Study Buddy. A chat bot that helps answer all your Math-related questions, helps you plan and organize your study breaks better, 
and also provides you with healthy, nutritious choices to fuel your study sessions!

The default mode is asking Math questions. For example, you could type in questions such as: "How do you find the intersection of a line and a plane?" or "How to solve these algebraic equations?"

When you're a bit tired and feel like taking a study break, just ask (you may use the button for convenience)

And if you're feeling hungry, just ask (you may use the food icon) or say you would "like to eat now" and your buddy will give you food suggestions to satiate all your cravings.



Note: I wish I could say more here, but I don't wanna give away the bot's character. I'll leave that to you :) !
