Liquid Fun is meant to represent motion of particles in a liquid or that of liquid molecules. 


The first simulation is meant to resemble what you'd expect from any liquid: particles are spaced apart, but not too much, move according to some set of rules (bonding and intermolecular forces of attraction). 
You may observe particles form small clusters occasionally. 

The second simulation is meant to show how the motion of particles in a liquid changes when the strength of intermolecular forces between particles increases.
The particles are now observed to form larger clusters and attract each other more frequently. The motion should still be somewhat haphazard but not completely random.

THe third and final simulation is meant to represent the state change from a liquid to a solid by changing the strength of intermolecular forces between the particles. 
THe user can adjust the "bonding strength" on a scale of 1-10 to view how motion slows down, particles clump togehter and eventually fill up the entire lattice (as in a solid)



Reflection: Overall, I think the simulations ran better than I expected. I particularly liked the third one and how it showed the change from a liquid to a solid, and at bonding
strength of "10" accurately captured how a solid has fixed particles filling up the lattice with some vibrating motion. The first simulation had sort of a delay (about 10 to 15 generations) for the 
liquid particles to "normalize" and actually behave the way I wanted them too. Like at the start there are very large clusters (contrary to how a liquid actually behaves) but it settles down and the particles spread out eventually.
