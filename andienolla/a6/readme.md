# Andie Nolla - A6

Thank you to Kate Compton for the starter code!

This emoji essay is inspired by my recent binge of late-90's/early-00's high school
 movies, such as Mean Girls, Clueless, or Easy A. The juicy, petty drama is so perfect
 for modeling using simulations!

In this simulation, I initially assume that only 5% of people will know the secret.
 If someone is gossiping with someone who knows a secret, they have a 70% chance of 
 telling their friends and continuing the chain. 

In the timeless version of this simulation, time is ignored. If someone ever learns a secret, they remember it forever.

In the interest version of this simulation, the board clears after all cells have been interacted with. This would represent a larger scope for rumors, where
gossip gets stale and people move on to caring about something different. 

Finally, in the messy version, time still exists, but for whatever reason people are feeling a
 little ravenous for drama, and people find out these rumors even quicker.
